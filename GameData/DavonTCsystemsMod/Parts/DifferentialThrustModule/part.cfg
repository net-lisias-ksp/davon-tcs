description = Davon TC systems supply advanced throttle control capabilities. This includes but is not limited to additional throttles, settings which modify the response of individual engines to throttle input and, using technology of a bygone era, it also supplies a very functional center thrust mode which adjusts the thrust of individual engines, lining up the center of thrust with the center of mass.
